Computers use electrical signals that are on or off, so they have to see everything as a series of binary numbers.

This data is represented as a sequence of 1s and 0s (on and off). 

### What is binary?

Binary is a number system that only uses two digits: 1 and 0. All information that is processed by a computer is in the form of a sequence of 1s and 0s. 

Therefore, all data that we want a computer to process needs to be converted into binary.

The binary system is known as a ‘base 2’ system. This is because:
- there are only two digits to select from (1 and 0)
- when using the binary system, data is converted using the power of two.
