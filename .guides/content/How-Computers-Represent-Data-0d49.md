All computer data is converted to a series of binary numbersâ€“ 1 and 0. 

For example, you see a sentence as a collection of letters, but the computer sees each letter as a collection of 1s and 0s. 

If a transistor is assigned a value of 1, it is on. If it has a value of 0, it is off. A computer's transistors can be switched on and off millions of times each second.
