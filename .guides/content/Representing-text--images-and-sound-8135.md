### Representing images

Images also need to be converted into binary in order for a computer to process them so that they can be seen on our screen. Digital images are made up of pixels. Each pixel in an image is made up of binary numbers.

If we say that 1 is black (or on) and 0 is white (or off), then a simple black and white picture can be created using binary.

This example shows an image created in this way:

### Representing sound

Sound needs to be converted into binary for computers to be able to process it. To do this, sound is captured - usually by a microphone - and then converted into a digital signal.

An analogue to digital converter will sample a sound wave at regular time intervals. For example, a sound wave like this can be sampled at each time sample point:

The samples can then be converted to binary. They will be recorded to the nearest whole number.
